### Hi there! 👋

> Embark on an immersive streaming journey with Yazi.tv, your gateway to a treasure trove of movies and TV series. Dive into a world of endless entertainment options at your fingertips, watch in real-time with friends and family, host watch parties complete with interactive chat, receive handpicked recommendations tailored to your viewing habits, and download content for offline enjoyment.
>
> Yazi.tv seamlessly transitions from Figma prototype to a robust web application crafted with React, Next, and TypeScript. My primary focus was delivering pixel-perfect design and establishing a captivating brand visual identity. Following this goal, I've designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure the best possible experience for all users in multiple devices.
>
> Under the hood, the codebase reflects a commitment to industry best practices for React and Next.js. We've meticulously dissected the application into reusable components, fostering efficiency, maintainability and end-to-end testing with Cypress to guarantee a seamless and bug-free experience from start to finish.
>
> As I don't own Netflix, our movie source was [the movie db api](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) (God bless them), let's pretend it's a Netflix-level application, okay ? hahahaha
